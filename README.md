Statistical analysis of the impact of education on domestic violence

The aim is to compare the results and identify the conditions under which the likelihood of domestic violence is highest and lowest. Factors examined include age, education, employment, marital status and income.

## Data gathering:
Collect relevant data from available studies and databases on domestic violence against women. Data will include information on women's age, education, employment, marital status and income.

## Data analysis:

Factors individually: Analysis of the effect of each factor (age, education, employment, marital status, income) on the likelihood of domestic violence.

Combination of factors: Analysis of the combined effects of factors, for example, how higher education affects income and how this is reflected in the incidence of domestic violence.

## Statistical techniques:

Using advanced statistical techniques to identify trends and patterns in the data. Methods used include:

- Distribution analysis: Analyzing the probability distribution of domestic violence in different settings.

- Regression analysis: Identifying the relationship between factors and the probability of domestic violence.

- Correlation analysis: Identifying strong and weak correlations between factors.

## Presentation of results:

Creating tables and charts to better understand and visualize the results of the analysis. Intended outcomes include:

- Tables: Clearly displaying the probabilities of domestic violence at different ages and under different conditions.
- Charts: Graphs showing trends and correlations, e.g., age pyramid of domestic violence, regression plots, etc.

## Interpretation and conclusions:

Based on the results of the analysis, determine which group of women is most subjected to domestic violence and under what conditions. The main objective is to answer the question: “Which group of women is most vulnerable to domestic violence?”
